A project for preparing Angular Interview, which contains angular related questions and examples.

Question 1:
Why it TypeScript needed inside Angular and what is pros and cons of TypeScript?

Typescript is the most popular statically typed language which is built around JavaScript, it means we have exactly the same syntax like JavaScript, but we are adding static typing to this. So that we are not getting errors in the runtime as JavaScript, we are getting errors in transpilation time, when we are transpiling typescript to JavaScript. TypeScript can not be directly used in browsers, we must always transpile typescript code to JavaScript code.

Getting transpilation errors is the most important benefit of TypeScript, and it is easier to scale our code because we are breaking less things; last but not lease, typeScript helps us to define entities.

cons: if you are simply a beginner, it is much more difficult to start with TypeScript and TypeScript can not really excuted in the browser, it takes quite a lot of time to transpile the code to JavaScript if the project is really huge.
